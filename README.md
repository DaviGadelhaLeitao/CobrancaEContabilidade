# Debts Register

A complete CRUD web application using HTML, CSS, SaSS, Bootstrap, Servlets, JSP, JDBC, MySQL, JavaScript, jQuery. Unit (mockito), integration and acceptance tests were done using jUNIT. Selenium is used for browser automation.

A automed build system is supplied with Ant and a basic deploy example is done locally with a shell script. Future versions of this application will evolve to use first Maven and then Gradle.
